# Caesar Cipher LLM Decryption Test

This project tests the ability of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a large language model (LLM), to decrypt messages encoded with Caesar ciphers of varying shift values.

## Project Overview

The main script `test.py` performs the following tasks:

1. Generates or loads a set of test phrases
2. Encodes these phrases using Caesar ciphers with shifts from 1 to 15
3. Sends the encoded phrases to Claude 3.5 Sonnet for decryption
4. Evaluates the accuracy of the LLM's decryption attempts

## Key Components

- `test.py`: The main Python script that runs the tests
- `test_phrases.txt`: A file containing the test phrases
- `caesar_cipher_test.log`: A log file that records the test results

## Results Summary

Based on the log file, here are the success rates for different shift values:

- Shift 1: 90% success (9/10)
- Shift 2: 100% success (10/10)
- Shift 3: 100% success (10/10)
- Shift 4: 90% success (9/10)
- Shifts 5-13: Results vary, but generally high success rates
- Shifts 14-15: Lower success rates, indicating increased difficulty

## Observations

1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs exceptionally well on lower shift values (1-4), with near-perfect accuracy.
2. The LLM maintains high accuracy for medium shift values.
3. Performance degrades for higher shift values (14-15), suggesting increased difficulty in decryption.
4. The model sometimes makes errors in word choice while maintaining the general meaning of the phrase.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that Claude 3.5 Sonnet can effectively generalize to decrypting Caesar ciphers with various shift values, particularly for lower and medium shifts. The model's performance on higher shifts suggests room for improvement in handling more complex encodings.

## Usage

To run the tests:

1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (asyncio, aiohttp, etc.)
2. Set up your Anthropic API key as an environment variable
3. Run the script: `python test.py`

Note: The script uses the Anthropic API, so make sure you have the necessary credentials and permissions.

## Future Work

- Expand the test set to include a wider variety of phrases and languages
- Test with other types of simple substitution ciphers
- Analyze the model's performance on negative shift values
- Analyze the model's performance on very large shift values (>15)
- Investigate strategies to improve performance on higher shift values
